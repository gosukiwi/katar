# Katar
Katar is a simple PHP templating engine based on Blade. It was designed to
be simple, and have a clean syntax. Katar doesn't get in your way, you can mix
PHP and Katar! 

## Syntax

    @if $age > 22
        <p>The age is bigger than 22</p>
    @else
        <p>The age is not bigger than 22</p>
    @endif

    @for $person in $people
        <p>Person #{{ $for_index + 1 }}: {{ $person->name }}</p>
    @endfor

    <p>My name is {{ $name | strtoupper }}</p>

    <?php echo 'Now I don\'t want to use Katar, I just use PHP'; ?>

    {>
        @this is escaped code, everything inside the escape tags won't get
        processed by Katar.
    <}
